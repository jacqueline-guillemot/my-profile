				<h2>ESSEC Voile and Noir Sur Blanc (NSB)</h2>
				<p>
					In the ESSEC Voile associaion we are doing regatas (sailing races) like the "Course Croisi√®re Edhec" but we also have a humanitarian project. We want to teach disabled teenagers how to sail. I love sailing, I come from a family of sailer (on both sides) so I have experience. On the other side, Noir Sur Blanc is a association where you learn how to take and edit pictures. We have a contract with Les Mardis de l'ESSEC, another association, and so we are taking pictures at all of their events. I really like both of the groups I am part of.

				<h2>My hobies</h2>
				<p>
					I have been swimmings since I am seven; I have always loved being in the water, in a completely different world where I can focus on myself. And have been practising modern-jazz dance for a long time too, but I do it to get the energy out of me. Indeed, I can sometimes compared with an electric battery, and dancig allow me to let it all go. Sometimes exhaustion is a good thing.

				<h2>Languages</h2>
				<p>
					French is my mother tongue, but I also speak english flently. I can also speak spanish and I am learning chinese. I love learning new languages becaus I know it improves my communication skills. ANd I belive that in such a big world with so many different cultures, communication is the key to understand them all.
